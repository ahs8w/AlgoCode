# Stock Market Basics
> Bid and Ask Prices: When a stock is listed for trading, it is assigned a bid price and an ask price. The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for the stock, while the ask price is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell the stock. The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the spread.

> Market Orders and Limit Orders: Investors can place different types of orders. A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at the current market price. It is executed immediately. A limit order, on the other hand, allows investors to specify the maximum price they are willing to pay (in the case of a buy order) or the minimum price they are willing to accept (in the case of a sell order). Limit orders are not executed until the specified price is reached.

> Stock Price Determination: The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand. When there are more buyers than sellers, the price tends to go up, and when there are more sellers than buyers, the price tends to go down. Factors such as company performance, industry trends, economic conditions, and investor sentiment can all influence stock prices.

# News Scraping
> If you require real-time data, you will need to design your script to periodically fetch updates. You can use techniques like scheduling tasks at fixed intervals or setting up event-driven systems to fetch data as soon as it becomes available.

> Check for RSS feeds: Many websites provide RSS feeds that allow you to receive updates whenever new articles are published. Look for an RSS feed link on the target websites. RSS feeds are structured XML files that contain information about the latest articles.

> Set up an RSS feed reader: Use an RSS feed reader or aggregator to subscribe to the RSS feeds of the websites you're interested in. There are various RSS feed reader applications and online services available that allow you to track multiple feeds in one place. Some popular options include Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur.

> Configure real-time notifications: Once you've set up your RSS feed reader, configure it to send real-time notifications. Most feed readers offer options to push notifications to your desktop, email, or mobile devices whenever new articles are published in the feeds you're subscribed to.
